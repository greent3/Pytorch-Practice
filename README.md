# Pytorch-Practice

Building a neural network while following along with StatQuest's introduction to Pytorch video!

Input: Drug dose between 0 and 1

Output: Efficacy between 0 (not effective) and 1 (effective)

We'll use pytorch to hard-code our weights and biases (with the exception of our final bias), along with pytorch's ReLU activation function. 

Finally, we'll run multiple gradient descent epochs to optimize our final bias value.
